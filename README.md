C-OMBAT 2023 was the first event organized by the First Year students of the 2022â€“26 batch of Coochbehar Government Engineering College.

The competitive event was organized for fellow first year students, including first-time coders, based exclusively on C programming language, to provide them with a level playing ground to allow them to showcase their logical skills, irrespective of their past associations with coding at the school level, which is usually based on Python or Java.

## The Event
The event was organized at Seminar Hall, Administrative Building, CGEC on 8th May 2023 from 3:50 pm onwards. The event was split into two rounds: Problem Solving round, and Quiz round.

### Problem Solving round
The problem-solving round was conducted on HackerRank. Although the event has already ended, the problem statements continue to be available at the [following link](https://www.hackerrank.com/cgec-com23), and open for everyone to view and attempt.

All but one questions were created by the organizers of the event by taking inspirations from many sources to match the unique needs of the event. Sample solutions are available [here](https://github.com/soukarya27cse/CGEC-COMBAT-2023/tree/main/problem-solving-solutions). Each question carried 100 points irrespective of their difficulty level. The individual problems may be found at:
